---OBJECTIVES

1) Retrieve data containing information on students who have achieved completion of their title/grade and order it from highest to lowest grades. Exclude null results. ***
select first_name, title, grade 
FROM students 
INNER JOIN papers 
ON students.id = papers.students_id 
Where first_name, title, grade is not null
ORDER BY grade DESC;

2) Retrieve data containing information on every student's name regardless if they have not completed their titles/grades.***
SELECT first_name, title, grade
    FROM students
    LEFT JOIN papers
      ON students.id = papers.students_id
    
3) Retrieve data containing information on every student's name regardless if they have not completed their titles/grades... But update records with present NULL values 
by returning 'MISSING' in the title field and a '0' for the grade field.
SELECT
    first_name,
    IFNULL(title, 'MISSING'),
    IFNULL(grade, 0)
FROM students
LEFT JOIN papers
    ON students.id = papers.students_id;

4) Aggregate the grade averages for each student.
SELECT first_name, AVG(grade)
    FROM students
    LEFT JOIN papers
      ON students.id = papers.students_id
    GROUP BY first_name;

# How can the work I've done optimize the generation of business insights?
Aggregating and analyzing student data can help stakeholders identify departmental areas that might need enhancement, which can lead to data-driven 
improvements in teaching methodologies, curricula, and student/teacher support services.
